# 1.Why do we use functions in JavaScript?
Like any other programming language,function in javasript is piece of code which takes input parameters,do the task and produce and output.They promotes the concept of DRY(DO NOT REPEAT) of programming.In javascript,function can be declared using function keyword or arrow function can also be used.
ex: function myname(){
    console.log("ganesh")
}
arrow functons
const myname = ()=>{
     console.log("ganesh")
}

# 2.What is Function Invocation?
Function invocation is calling of a function at any point in program so that the code inside it can be executed.
ex:function myage(age){
    console.log(age)
}

myage(20);//this is invoking the function

# 3.Does a function behave like an object in Javascript? Prove it by an example.
Yes,in Jvascript functions are first class objects only.
example: 
function showNames() {
  const student = 'Citrus';

  console.log(`My favorite ice student is ${student}}`);
}

//assign a property.
showNames.houses = ['green', 'blue', 'red'];

console.log(showNames);
//output:
//func as an object can be assigned properties and accessed also
{ [Function: showNames]
// houses : ['green', 'blue', 'red']; }


# 4.What are Events in Javascript?
Events are all the actions which happen on the HTML page and through Javascript those actions get a reaction if required.for ex:click,mouseover,keypress,etc are events in javascript.

# 5.What is a string?
Javascript string like any other programming language is data type to store a series of characters which are enclosed in singlt or double quotes.for ex:"pragya" ,"1",'my son is god',etc all are string in javascript.

# 6.What is an array? Is it static or dynamic in Javascript?
Array is also an object in javascript but it stores data in sequential manner.They can be accessed with their respective indices unlike objects where key name is used.Indexing in js starts from 0.
Arrays in JS are dynamic in nature that means its length can be changed during runtime.
for ex:
var arr = [];
    // array size is not dot defined
    // Initiating loop to iterate
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 
        // Feeding integer inputs to array
        arr[i] = +prompt('Enter number');

# 7.Difference between Map and Set?
MAP like an object has key value pairs where keys can be of any type unlike objects where as SET is a an array of all unique items only.
Map is accessed through key and sets through indices.

# 8.Difference between Array and Map?
Array is collection of objects of similar types where as MAP is similar to objects having key value pairs where keys can be of any type.

# 9.What are array methods? List a few names?
Various array methods are:
array.push,array.pop,array.sort,array.shift,array.unshift,array.reduce,array.length,array.splice,array.some,array.map,array.foreach,array.filter etc.

# 10.In how many ways can we traverse through an array in Javascript?
-by looping using while or for loop,
-map,filter,every,reduce,forEach,some,indexOf,find,etc.
